                    <summary>What kind of results can I expect?</summary>
                    <p>Results vary by industry, competition, and starting point, but our clients typically see significant improvements within 3-6 months.

                    <summary>How do you measure success?</summary>
                    <p>We measure success using key performance indicators aligned with your business goals: lead generation numbers, revenue attribution from marketing channels, search engine rankings for target keywords, website traffic and engagement metrics, conversion rates across different touchpoints, customer acquisition costs, and lifetime value of customers.

Local SEO typically delivers results in 2-3 months. Organic SEO builds momentum over 4-6 months. Social media growth accelerates after 2-3 months. Most comprehensive campaigns show measurable improvements within 60-90 days, with compounding results over time.</p>
