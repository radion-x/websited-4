                            <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;">We help reduce OTA dependency through direct booking optimisation.

                            <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;">We develop comprehensive seasonal marketing strategies that include ramping up advertising before peak seasons to capture early bookings, creating off-season promotions and packages to maintain occupancy, adjusting keyword targeting based on seasonal search trends, email campaigns to past guests promoting shoulder season deals, and content marketing around seasonal events and attractions. We also use data analytics to predict demand patterns and adjust budgets accordingly.</p>

                            <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;">Low season marketing requires a multi-channel approach: targeting domestic travelers and staycationers through local SEO and Google Ads, creating attractive packages bundling accommodation with experiences, partnering with local businesses for cross-promotion, email campaigns to past guests with exclusive off-season rates, content marketing around indoor activities and seasonal attractions, and targeting corporate travelers for business stays. We also recommend adjusting your messaging to emphasize value and unique low-season experiences.</p>

                            <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;">Social media is essential for restaurant marketing. Instagram and TikTok drive significant discovery for dining venues, with 75% of diners checking social media before choosing a restaurant. We create mouth-watering visual content, user-generated content campaigns, influencer partnerships, and targeted advertising that showcases your food, ambiance, and unique experiences. Social media also provides excellent ROI for promoting events, seasonal menus, and special offers.</p>

                            <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;">Independent hotels and smaller properties can compete effectively by emphasizing unique selling points that chains cannot offer: authentic local experiences, personalized service, character and charm, local partnerships, and community connections. We help you tell your unique story through content marketing, target niche audiences actively seeking boutique experiences, optimise for long-tail keywords chains ignore, and build a strong local presence through community engagement and local SEO. Many travelers specifically prefer independent properties.</p>
