                                <span style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">Dozens of competitors in every suburb all fighting for the same customers. Without strong local visibility, homeowners call the first business they find - and that's not you.</span>

                                <span style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">Feast or famine cycles make it hard to plan. Summer heat waves flood HVAC with calls while winter slows landscapers to a crawl. You need marketing that adapts to demand.</span>

                                <span style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">Homeowners are inviting strangers into their homes. They need to trust you before they call. Without reviews and a professional online presence, they'll choose your competitor.</span>

                                <span style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">One bad review can tank your reputation. But getting happy customers to leave reviews feels impossible. You need a system that generates consistent positive reviews automatically.</span>

                                <span style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6;">Race-to-the-bottom pricing erodes your margins. When you look like everyone else, customers shop on price alone. You need to differentiate on value and service quality, not cost.</span>

                            <h3 style="font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 600; color: #111827; margin-bottom: 1rem;">How do you handle seasonal fluctuations in demand?</h3>
                            <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;">We adjust your marketing strategy based on seasonal demand patterns. During peak seasons (summer for HVAC cooling, winter for heating), we scale up ad spend and target high-intent emergency keywords. During slower periods, we focus on maintenance contracts, preventive services, and brand building. We also use email and SMS campaigns to generate demand for seasonal tune-ups before the rush hits, helping you smooth out the feast-or-famine cycle.</p>

                            <h3 style="font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 600; color: #111827; margin-bottom: 1rem;">How do you market emergency services effectively?</h3>
                            <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;">Emergency service marketing requires immediate visibility when homeowners need help right now. We set up Google Ads campaigns targeting urgent keywords like "emergency plumber" and "24 hour electrician" with high bids during after-hours and weekends. We optimise your website for fast loading and prominent phone numbers. Call-only ads connect customers directly to you. We also implement call tracking so you know exactly which campaigns generate emergency calls and can measure their true value.</p>

                        <div style="background: white; border-radius: 12px; padding: 2rem; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
                            <h3 style="font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 600; color: #111827; margin-bottom: 1rem;">What's the typical cost per lead for home services?</h3>
                            <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;">Cost per lead varies by trade and market competition. Plumbing leads typically range from $25-75, electrical from $30-80, HVAC from $40-100, and landscaping from $20-60. Emergency service leads cost more due to higher competition and value. We continuously optimise campaigns to reduce costs while improving lead quality. The real metric we focus on is cost per booked job, which accounts for lead quality and your team's closing rate. One good job can return 10-50x your lead cost.</p>

                            <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;">We implement automated review request systems that send SMS and email prompts after every job completion. We optimise the timing and messaging to maximize response rates - typically 24-48 hours after the job while the experience is fresh. We also set up monitoring alerts for new reviews so you can respond quickly, and provide templates for handling both positive and negative feedback professionally. Our clients typically see their review count grow 3-5x within the first year, with average ratings improving to 4.8+ stars.</p>

                            <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;">Absolutely! Google Local Service Ads are perfect for home services businesses and often deliver the best ROI. We handle the entire setup including Google Guarantee badge verification, license and insurance uploads, background check coordination, and profile optimisation. We manage your weekly budget, dispute invalid leads, and track lead quality. LSA leads are pay-per-lead (not per click), so you only pay for actual customer contacts. Most of our home services clients see their best results from LSA.</p>

                            <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;">We work with home service businesses of all sizes, from owner-operators with one van to companies with 50+ technicians. Our strategies scale to your budget and goals. For smaller operations, we focus on high-ROI activities like Google Business Profile optimisation, review generation, and targeted local ads. For larger companies, we implement comprehensive multi-channel campaigns with advanced tracking, CRM integration, and automation. Whether you're looking to book 10 more jobs per month or 100, we have solutions that fit.</p>

                            <p style="color: #6b7280; line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;">Google Ads and Local Service Ads can generate leads within the first week of launch - often within days. SEO results typically take 2-4 months to see significant ranking improvements, with compounding results over 6-12 months as your authority builds. We set up tracking from day one so you can see exactly where leads come from and measure ROI in real-time. Most clients see positive ROI within the first 30-60 days from paid campaigns, while SEO builds long-term sustainable lead flow.</p>
